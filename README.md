# Roguefallen
an open-source 2D roguelike game made with Unity

The repository of this game is officially hosted at https://github.com/Almondbuns/Roguefallen under the Apache 2.0 license.

# Compile Instructions
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Install the latest stable version of Unity from unity.com. The currently used version in the project is 2022.3.16f1 but may change faster than this file.
3. In Unity import the repository directory as a new existing project
4. Unity should now automatically ask to import TextMesh Pro which is needed to render text in the game. If no automatic prompt is shown you can manually install TextMesh Pro in Unity (Window -> TextMeshPro -> Install TMP Essential Resources)
5. Select the TextMesh Pro Essential Files import
6. Close and open the project again to help TextMesh Pro to register all fonts
7. That should be it! Click 'Play' in the Unity Editor or build a version of the game.

Every time you pull a new version from the repository Unity should be smart enough to automatically update once the unity app gets focus. In case of problems try to close and open the unity editor again.
